## 'nbases - number bases conversions'

'nbases' is a library that provides basics number bases 
conversions. I've written this library, previosuly, in 
python. And then, I aslo decided to write this library 
in C. This library consists of two part. First is some 
methods which checks, prepares and converts given values. 
These are:

+ remove_char()
+ is_proper()
+ get_pow()
+ str_to_num()
+ clamper()
+ num_to_char()
+ hex_chars()
+ num_to_str()
+ hex_to_num()

Second is the main methods provides the basics number
base conversions including:

+ dec_to_bin()      (decimal to binary)
+ dec_to_oct()      (decimal to octal)
+ dec_to_hex()      (decimal to hexadecimal)
+ bin_to_dec()      (binary to decimal)
+ bin_to_oct()      (binary to octal)
+ bin_to_hex()      (binary to hexadecimal)
+ oct_to_dec()      (octal to decimal)
+ oct_to_bin()      (octal to binary)
+ oct_to_hex()      (octal to hexadecimal)
+ hex_to_dec()      (hexadecimal to decimal)
+ hex_to_bin()      (hexadecimal to binary)
+ hex_to_oct()      (hexadecimal to octal)

Also, you can inspect the same library written in Python.
